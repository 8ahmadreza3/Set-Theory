**In this repository, set theory including four main operations ( union, intersection, relative complement, complement ) have been implemented with the necessary methods**

How this project work?

If we assume that A and B are two sets, you can do these things in the terminal:

Definition : ` A = {} `

Universal : ` U `

Union : ` A + B `

Intersection : ` A * B `

Complement : ` -A `

Diffrence : ` A - B `

Print : ` A `
